## Min Heap Construction

- Implement a MinHeap class that supports:  
  * Building a Min Heap from an input array of integers.
  * Inserting integers in the heap.
  * Removing the heap's minimum / root value.
  * Peeking at the heap's minimum / root value.
  * Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting andremoving values.

- The heap should be represented in the form of an array.

- A min-heap is a binary tree such that:
  * the data contained in each node is less than (or equal to) the data in that nodeâ€™s children.
  * the binary tree is complete
