## Min Number Of Coins For Change

- Given an array of positive integers representing coin denominations and a single non-negative integer n representing a target amount of money, write a function that returns the smallest number of coins needed to make change for that target amount using the given coin denominations.
- Note that you have access to an unlimited amount of coins. If it's impossible to make change for the target amount return -1.
